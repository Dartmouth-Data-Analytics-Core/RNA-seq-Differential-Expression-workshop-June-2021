## RNA-seq differential expresssion workshop, August 2021

This workshop will be delivered on August 23, 25, & 27 by the Data Analytics Core (DAC) of the [Center for Quantitative Biology at Dartmouth](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/).

The DAC aims to facilitate advanced bioinformatic, computational, and statistical analysis of complex genomics data for the Dartmouth research community.

If you have questions about this workshop, or would like to discuss data analysis services available from the Data Analytics Core, please visit out [website](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/cqb/projects-and-cores/data-analytics-core/), or email us at: DataAnalyticsCore@groups.dartmouth.edu
